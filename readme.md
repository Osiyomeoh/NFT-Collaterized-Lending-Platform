NFT Loan Process Workflow
This document outlines the workflow for an NFT-based loan system, detailing the steps involved from staking an NFT to loan liquidation.

Workflow Steps
1. Stake an NFT
User Interface: Provide users with a selection of available NFTs to stake.
Action: Users choose an NFT from their collection to stake for a loan.
2. NFT Evaluation
Process: The selected NFT is evaluated to determine its market value.
Output: Based on the evaluation, a limit on the amount the user can borrow is provided.
3. Request Loan
User Action: Users submit a loan request.
Execution: Upon approval, the requested loan amount is sent directly to the user's wallet.
4. Interest Calculation and Default Management
Interest and Duration: The system calculates the interest accrued over the loan duration.
Default Handling: If the user defaults on the loan, the staked NFT is liquidated.
5. Add Balance to Contract
Final Action: Proceeds from the liquidation are added back to the contract balance, ensuring funds are available for future loans.
